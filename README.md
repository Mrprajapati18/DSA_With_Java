# <h1 align="center">ðŸ“š 100 Days of Data Structure And Algorithms</h1>


Starting a 100 Days Code Challenge for Data Structure And Algorithm from Scratch is my target to learn DSA by:
- Array: Array operations and problems
- 2D_Array: Two-dimensional array problems
- String: String data Structure And Algorithm
- LinkedList: Linked List implementations and problems
- Stack: Stack data structure and applications
- Queues: Queue data structure and problems
- HashMap: Hash map implementations and problems
- BinaryTree: Binary tree problems and implementations
- BinarySearchTree: BST operations and problems
- Heap: Heap data structure and priority queue problems
- Trie: Trie data structure implementations
